The **Password Store** project is a decentralized, Ethereum-based **password management system**. I conducted an **extensive security audit** to ensure the platformâ€™s robustness.

## Key Contributions

- **Code Analysis**: Reviewed Solidity contracts for vulnerabilities.
- **Security Enhancements**: Suggested improvements to fortify data encryption.
- **Efficiency Optimization**: Reduced gas costs and enhanced smart contract execution.

## Why Secure Password Management?

- **Decentralized Security**: Eliminates single points of failure.
- **User-Controlled Access**: Ensures privacy without third-party risks.
- **Immutable Records**: Prevents unauthorized modifications.
