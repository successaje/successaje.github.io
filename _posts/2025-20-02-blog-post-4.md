## My Experience at Africa Hack 2025

Africa Hack 2025 in Lagos was an exciting and intense hackathon experience. Although the hackathon was planned to last a week, the physical event was condensed into three days. I had to travel from Akure to Lagos on Friday, arriving around 1â€“2 PM. Upon arrival, I realized that some tracks had changed, which significantly affected my plans, leaving me with only one full dayâ€”Saturdayâ€”to restart and work on my project - a new one. Despite the sudden changes, I was determined to make the most of the opportunity.

## Introducing CoinGenie

CoinGenie is an AI-powered assistant designed as a Telegram bot to onboard users into the Web3 space effortlessly. The goal is to enhance adoption by leveraging Telegramâ€™s widespread reach and ease of use. Users can interact with CoinGenie to:

- Ask questions about Web3 and blockchain technology
- Access learning resources
- Create **Slanor** and **Flow** wallets
- Perform basic transactions, including balance checks and fund transfers
- Navigate through a **3D space** with AI guidance

We envision expanding CoinGenie to support more blockchains, including Ethereum, Bitcoin, ICP, and additional functionalities that simplify Web3 interactions.

## Development Process

Given my limited time, I adopted a **Jogging Face AI model** approach, implementing it in Python. I had to train the model myself with a relatively small dataset, so while the AIâ€™s communication abilities were decent, they werenâ€™t as vast as I had initially envisioned. Regardless, I made significant progress:

- Developed the AI assistant to process user queries and provide relevant responses
- Implemented wallet creation and transaction functionalities
- Integrated Telegramâ€™s API for seamless bot interactions

Due to the changes in the hackathon schedule, I felt a bit disappointed, but I pushed through. I started working on Saturday afternoon, coding almost non-stop until midnight. By Sunday, I dedicated time to refining my **pitch deck** and preparing my submission.

## Why Telegram Bots?

The primary reason for choosing Telegram bots is **adoption and accessibility**. Many mainstream users find Web3 complex, so using familiar platforms like Telegram lowers the barrier to entry. CoinGenie is designed to simplify onboarding, education, and transactions in a way that is:

- **User-Friendly**: No need for complex wallet setups or external apps.
- **Effortless Integration**: Users can interact with blockchain features directly within Telegram.
- **Scalable**: We plan to expand to multiple blockchain networks over time.

## Looking Ahead

While we successfully integrated **Solana** and **Flow** wallets, our future roadmap includes:

- Adding support for Ethereum, Bitcoin, and ICP wallets
- Enhancing AI capabilities for more intuitive interactions
- Implementing real-time notifications for Web3 transactions

We believe CoinGenie can be a game-changer in making Web3 more accessible to the masses.

## Final Thoughts

Despite the unexpected hurdles, participating in **Africa Hack 2025** was an enriching experience. It reinforced my ability to **adapt, innovate, and execute** under pressure. CoinGenie is just the beginning of whatâ€™s possible in AI-driven Web3 solutions, and Iâ€™m excited to continue building and improving it.
